They wear a fitted, dark leather tunic reinforced with subtle, overlapping scales for protection without sacrificing agility. A hood, often drawn low, casts a shadow over sharp featuresâ€”cheekbones high and prominent, framing a pair of keen, observant eyes that glint like shards of polished steel. Their skin bears the faint, sun-kissed tone of someone often outdoors yet cloaked in shadow. A small collection of scarsâ€”a nick on the brow, a faint line across one handâ€”suggests experience rather than recklessness. At their side, a pair of daggers rest in worn leather sheaths, the hilts wrapped in strips of dark cloth for a surer grip. A weathered pouch hangs from their belt, hinting at hidden supplies, and their boots, soft-soled and expertly worn-in, make no sound even on the roughest ground. A faint air of mystery surrounds Darryn, their gaze a blend of guarded intensity and an almost restless curiosity, as though they are constantly calculating the next move.";
